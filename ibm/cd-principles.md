# CD Principles

## 1. Build in Quality
- You need to ensure that you have quality built in at every step.
- Quality can be achieved by continually reviewing your code. Every pull request is an opportunity for a code review and quality check.  
- make sure that everything looks good all the way along your pipeline. 

## 2. Work in Small Batches
- make your user stories small; it’s best to make small changes because less change means less risk. 
- continuously integrate these changes with the base code so that the changes never drift too far from the base that everyone else is working from..

## 3. People Solve Problems
- people shouldn’t be required to perform repetitive tasks. In fact, people are terrible at performing repetitive tasks. They get easily bored and distracted. 
- Computers can perform these tasks more quickly and efficiently than you or I

## 4. Pursue Continuous Improvements
- enables relentless continuous improvement
  
  >The more often you do something, the better you get at it, and the less likely it is to fail. 
- By delivering each change to a known working environment, you should continually know where you are and when things are broken.

## 5. Everyone is Responsible
- if a build does break, it’s not a case of finger-pointing and asking, “Whose fault is it?” 
- What you should be asking is, “What went wrong?” and “How can we prevent this from happening in the future?” 
- What you need to consider is more about the system’s failings rather than the people’s failings.
