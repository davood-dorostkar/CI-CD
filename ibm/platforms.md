# Platforms and Tools

## What tool to use?
Different line of business applications (or LOBs) within a single organization being run by different teams, might be using different tools, and it doesn’t matter that they use different tools.

What matters is that they’re using a tool to automate these processes instead of doing them manually.

there's a plethora of tools for CI/CD you can choose from.

most of the top ones all seem similar and have similar ways of working and similar concepts. So, if you try out a tool, and decide that you don't like it, you can just keep trying new ones until you find a tool that you like to use.

## Common Tools

### Jenkins
Jenkins is CI/CD software that is installed on a server where the central build will take place. It is one of the oldest, most popular, and most complex of all the CI/CD tools. 

### Circle CI
Circle CI is a CI/CD platform that can be used to implement DevOps practices. It performs deployments for Continuous Delivery and you define workflows inside a `circle.yaml` file.

### Travis CI
Travis CI is a hosted CI service that helps developers build and test software projects hosted on GitHub and Bitbucket. Travis CI was the first CI service to provide free services to open-source projects. It also performs deployments for Continuous Delivery and you define a workflow inside a `.travis.yaml` file.

### GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that enables you to automate your build, test, and deploy GitHub workflows. Unlike other tools, it only works with GitHub.
