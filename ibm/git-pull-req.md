# Pull request workflow 
> This seems simple at first but needs attention

1. `checkout` the main branch and `pull` any new changes to your local workspace. 
2. `switch` to the feature branch that you’ve been making changes to, and `merge` in any new code from the main branch. This ensures that you have the latest changes from the main branch included in your branch. This may cause `merge conflicts` that you’ll have to resolve manually.
3. Once any merge conflicts have been resolved and coding is complete, `push` your local branch to your remote repo. 
4. Finally, create a `pull request` and have it reviewed and `merged` into the remote repository.
